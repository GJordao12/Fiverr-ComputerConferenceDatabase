# Computer Conference Database (Fiverr Project)

* **Language:** SQL and PLSQL
* **Project Description:** The objective of the project was to develop a database for a company where the conferences available for them and everything related to them (participants, payments, ...) could be stored. In addition, I was requested to create [queries](/SQLFiles/queries.sql), [procedures](/SQLFiles/procedures.sql) and [triggers](/SQLFiles/triggers.sql) to be able to observe certain information from the database. It was also requested that the database be loaded with test information, so [inserts](/SQLFiles/inserts.sql) had to be created. Lastly the buyer asked you to justify/explain the ERD, so that information is in the [word file](/ERDiagramJustifications).
